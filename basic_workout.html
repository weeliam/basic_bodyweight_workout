        <p class="lead">Before any type of exercise, it’s important to warm up for at least 5-10 minutes. This allows time for the body to adjust to the intensity of the upcoming physical activity and helps to reduce the risk of injury. After warming up, it’s important to stretch in order to maintain flexibility.</p>

 				<p class="lead">Warm ups before exercise are essential for any type of physical activity. Doing warm up exercises helps to increase body temperature, blood flow and helps to prepare muscles for the upcoming exercise. Warm ups also help to reduce the risk of injury and improve performance.</p>

				<p class="lead">Common warm up exercises include dynamic stretching, jogging, jumping jacks, mountain climbers and squats. These exercises help to increase flexibility and range of motion, reducing the risk of injury. Dynamic stretching is a great way to warm up as it helps to increase body temperature and prepare the muscles for exercise.</p>

        <p class="lead">Mobility exercises are movements that help to improve flexibility, range of motion, and overall joint health. Examples of mobility exercises as a warm up before training include dynamic stretching, foam rolling, and dynamic warm-up drills. Dynamic stretching involves actively moving joints and muscles through their full range of motion, while foam rolling is a form of self-myofascial release that helps to reduce tension and tightness in the muscles. Dynamic warm-up drills involve movements that mimic the activity you are about to perform and help to activate the muscles and increase blood flow to the area.</p>

        <p class="lead">Push-ups are a great exercise for building upper body strength and endurance. They primarily work the muscles of the chest (pectoralis major and minor), triceps (back of the arms), and shoulders (deltoids). In addition, they also engage the muscles of the core, including the abdominals and lower back. Push-ups are a compound exercise, meaning they work multiple muscle groups at once, making them an efficient and effective exercise for building overall upper body strength.</p>

        <h3>How to do do the exercise</h3>

        <p class="lead">Start by getting into a plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your feet together.</p>

Specifically, they work the erector spinae muscles, which run along the length of the spine and help to maintain posture and support the back. Additionally, dorsal raises can also engage the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and abdominal muscles to a lesser extent, depending on the execution and form of the exercise.</p>

        <h3>How to do do the exercise</h3>

        <p class="lead">Lie face down on the floor with your hands at your temples and your shoulders relaxed. Take a deep breath in, lifting your chest off the floor using your lower back muscles and glutes. Hold briefly, then, while breathing out, slowly lower back to the floor.</p>

		<p class="lead">Make sure you don’t arch your neck back during the raise. Keep looking forwards, and don’t “throw” your shoulders back to aid the movement. Move slowly and with control at all times to maximise the benefits. The other key form tip is not to overextend your back. You don’t have to raise as far as you possibly can – just lift until you feel it in your lower back muscles, and then lower.</p>

		<p class="lead">Keep your feet on the floor when first doing the move, and once you are adept at it you can increase the move’s difficulty by raising your feet. You can also stretch your arms out in front of you, or even hold a light weight, to intensify the challenge when doing the dorsal raise.</p>

        <p class="lead">The plank is a great exercise that primarily targets the core muscles, including the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and obliques. Additionally, it also works the muscles of the lower back, shoulders, and glutes. By holding the plank position, you can build strength and stability in your entire midsection, which can help improve your posture, reduce the risk of back pain, and enhance your overall athletic performance.</p>

        <h3>How to do do the exercise</h3>

        <p class="lead">To begin, lie flat with your belly facing the ground with your legs level and upper torso propped up by your forearms.</p>

		<p class="lead">Lower your back and shoulder muscles, raise your buttocks off the ground.</p>

		<p class="lead">Hold as long as you can (target for periods of 30 to 45 seconds ) and then relax.</p>

Generally, exercises for strength are performed with a slower tempo, meaning that you would take longer to complete the movement. For example, if you are doing a squat, you would take 3-4 seconds to lower yourself down, pause for a second at the bottom, then take 2-3 seconds to come back up. This slower tempo helps to increase the time under tension, which helps to maximize the strength gains from the exercise.</p>

If one of the exercise in the workout is to difficulty just change it for an easier exercise. On the other side of the spectrum if you find the exercise easy you can progress to a harder one.</p>

		<p class="lead">Bodyweight workouts are a great way to get in shape without having to go to the gym or use any fancy equipment. All you need is your own bodyweight and a little bit of space to move around in.</p>

		<p class="lead">To get started, plan to do a basic bodyweight workout three times a week, making sure you have at least a day of rest in between each workout. This will give your muscles time to recover and prevent injury.</p>

        <h3>Reps</h3>

        <p class="lead"><strong>Definition of Reps</strong></p>

		<p class="lead"><em>Reps = the number of times you perform a given exercise</em></p> 

		

        <h3>Sets</h3>

        <p class="lead"><strong>Definition of Sets</strong></p>

		<p class="lead"><em>Sets = the number of cycles of reps you complete</em></p>

		<p class="lead">Reps and sets are an important part of any bodyweight workout. Reps, or repetitions, refer to the number of times you perform a certain exercise. Sets refer to the number of times you perform a group of exercises. For example, if you are doing a bodyweight workout that includes 10 push-ups, you would do 10 reps of push-ups and that would be one set.</p>

		<p class="lead">Reps and sets are important for bodyweight workouts because they help you build strength and endurance. By doing multiple sets of an exercise, you are able to increase your muscular endurance and build strength. Doing multiple reps of an exercise also helps you to increase your muscular endurance and build strength.</p>

		<p class="lead">When doing bodyweight workouts, it is important to make sure that you are doing the right number of reps and sets for your fitness level. If you are a beginner, it is best to start with fewer reps and sets and gradually increase as you get stronger. If you are more advanced, you can increase the number of reps and sets to challenge yourself and help you reach your fitness goals.</p>

		<h4>Example reps and sets:</h4>

		<ul class="workout">
			<li class="workout"> - Push-up: 3 sets of 10 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Diamond Push-ups: 3 sets of 8 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Sit up: 3 sets of 12 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Bicycle crunches: 3 sets of 12 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Plank: 3 sets of 30 secs, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Dorsal raise: 3 sets of 12 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Squats: 3 sets of 12 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Lunges: 3 sets of 12 reps (each leg), rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Burpees: 3 sets of 12 reps, rest 30 seconds in between sets</li>

        <p class="lead">A timed circuit with a set split of 10 to 40 seconds work and 5 to 20 seconds rest between exercises with a 1 to 2 minutes rest between sets is a type of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). This type of workout involves alternating short bursts of intense exercise with short periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. The goal is to push the body to its maximum capacity for a short period of time. HIIT workouts are an effective way to burn fat and build muscle in a short amount of time.</p>

		<h4>Example timed circuit:</h4>
		<ul class="workout">
			<li class="workout"> - Push-up (1 minute)</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Squat (1 minute)</li>
			<li class="workout"> - Situp (1 minute)</li>

        <p class="lead">Exercising is a great way to stay fit and healthy, but it’s important to make sure that you’re giving your body enough time to rest and recover. Cooldown after exercise is an important part of the process, as it helps to bring your heart rate and breathing rate back to normal and prevent any soreness or injuries.</p>

		<p class="lead">Cooldown typically involves five to ten minutes of stretching and light aerobic activity, such as walking or jogging. This can help to restore your body to its pre-exercise state and reduce lactic acid buildup. Stretching can also help to reduce tightness in the muscles, improve range of motion, and reduce the risk of injury.</p>

		<p class="lead">Some people also like to practice deep breathing or meditation during their cooldown period, as these activities can help to reduce stress and promote relaxation. Additionally, drinking plenty of water and having a healthy snack can help to replenish the nutrients that have been lost during exercise.</p>

		<p class="lead">Including cooldown in your exercise routine can be a great way to help your body recover and prevent any injuries. Taking the time to properly cool down after exercising can help to ensure that your body is able to perform at its best.</p>

        <p class="lead">In summary if you're looking to get in shape but don't have access to a gym or equipment, a basic bodyweight workout is a great option. By simply using your own body weight as resistance, you can build strength and improve your overall fitness.</p>

		<p class="lead">To get started, plan to do a basic bodyweight workout three times a week, making sure you have at least a day of rest in between each workout. This will give your muscles time to recover and prevent injury.</p>

		<p class="lead">When designing your workout, focus on exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once. Some examples include push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and burpees. These exercises will work your entire body and help you get the most out of your workout.</p>

		<p class="lead">Start with a warm-up to get your heart rate up and your muscles ready for exercise. This could include jogging in place, jumping jacks, or even a few minutes of light stretching.</p>

		<p class="lead">Next, move on to your main workout. Aim to do three sets of each exercise, with 10-12 reps per set. If you're just starting out, you may want to start with fewer reps and work your way up as you get stronger.</p>

		<p class="lead">After your main workout, finish with a cool-down to help your body recover. This could include stretching, foam rolling, or even a few minutes of light yoga.</p>

		<p class="lead">Remember to listen to your body and take breaks as needed. If an exercise feels too challenging, modify it or take a break. And don't forget to stay hydrated throughout your workout.</p>

		<p class="lead">By doing a basic bodyweight workout three times a week, you can build strength, improve your fitness, and feel great. With a little consistency and dedication, you'll be on your way to a healthier, happier you.</p>
